# Foreword

Dynamic languages were seen in the past only as scripting languages, used to
automate small tasks, but with the passing of time, they grew, matured and
conquered their place in the market, to the point of calling the attention of
the major providers of technology.

Several factors contributed to this change, such as the internet, open source
software and agile development methodologies. The internet has enabled the
sharing of information in a way unprecedented in history, which made possible
the growth of open source software. Dynamic languages are usually open source
and share the same features and in some cases, the same goals.

Among the dynamic languages, Python stands out as one of the most popular and
powerful. There is a lively community of language users in the world, and this
is reflected in active mailing lists and many tools available in open source.

Learning a new programming language means learning to think differently. And
learn a dynamic language represents a paradigm shift even harder for those
people who have spent years developing in static languages.
